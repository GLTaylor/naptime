  <h4> I've plopped my ~Statement of Purpose~ below </h4>
 
  <div class="introduction"> I’m a great starter and a poor finisher. </div>

<p class="introduction"> This is a common trait of both the domesticated and wild <a href="https://www.16personalities.com"> ENFPs</a> Indigenous to everywhere, the ENFP of adult age is known to spy new opportunities and run full speed in their direction, sometimes forgetting their last pursuit entirely. With a penchant for spontaneity, they spring from interest to interest like lilypads. Their tragic inability: Focusing on one thing at a time, let alone finishing the things. For instance, I barely kept a consistent metaphor alive in this paragraph. </p> 

<p class="introduction"> Which brings me to my resolution: Goal Completion. Subtitle: Please (for the love of all things) finish like one or two of these projects you start.</p>

<p class="introduction"> At the top of my list are two skills that I’ve decided to stop circling and just pounce on already: German, and Coding.</p>

<p class="introduction"> You are reading (hey thanks for still reading woo!) the construction site where I’m building both of these skills block by block (see, again, can’t even stick with one metaphor). </p> 

<p class="introduction"> I’m participating in a Spring Language Challenge in which I learn German with a brave group of 24 colleagues over three months, which I shall chronicle in very, very brief episodes here. WHY BRIEF TAYLOR? I’m glad you asked. Because I am also coding this website, and more words is more coding, and I don't want to run out of steam.</p>  

<p class="introduction">  So. </p> 

<p class="introduction"> Check out the Blog page for German Stories, and the Stuff Tab to see what I’m playing with in Coding Land. I’m very new at this so it’s not going to impress anyone, but ENFPs are also known to be open books. Look at that, we’re at three metaphors now. I’ll quit while I’m ahead.</p>
