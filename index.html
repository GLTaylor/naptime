  <h2> I am Taylor </h2>
  <h3> Hello Webiverse </h3>
  <p> I'm learning how to write code. Some thoughts I have now:
    <ul id="thoughts">
      <li> I never thought it was <strong>so much work</strong> </li>
      <li> I hope I can build my own Writer's Portfolio </li>
      <li> Can I do this? Yes. <b style= "color:black"> Will I do this? Yes. </b> </li>
      <li> This page is comically ugly but that <em> will change!</em> </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
<p class="Introduction"> I’m a great starter and a poor finisher.</br>

Apparently this is a common trait of both the domesticated and wild ENFPs. Indigenous to everywhere, the ENFP of adult age is known to easily spot new opportunities and perceive almost all of them as potentially delicious a split second before and running full speed in their direction. The creature unites their knack for spontaneous activity with social poise as they spring from interest to interest like lillypads. Their tragic inability: Focusing on one thing at a time, let alone finishing the things. For instance, I barely kept a metaphor alive in this paragraph and now I’m already thinking about what my next one will be.</br> 

Which brings me to my resolution: Goal Completion. Subtitle: Please for the love of all things finish like one or two of these projects you start.</br> 

At the top of my list are two skills that I’ve decided to stop circling and just pounce on already: German, and Coding.</br>  

You are reading (hey thanks for still reading woo!) the construction site where I’m building both of these skills block by block (see, again, can’t even stick with one metaphor). </br> 

I’m participating in a Spring Language Challenge in which I learn German with a brave group of 24 colleagues, which I shall chronicle in very, very brief episodes here. WHY BRIEF TAYLOR? I’m glad you asked. Because I am also coding this website, and more words is more coding, and I want to actually finish, so.</br>  

So. </br> 

Check out the Blog page for German Stories, and the Stuff Tab to see what I’m playing with in Coding Land. I’m very new at this so it’s probably not going to impress anyone but ENFP are also known to be open books. Look at that, we’re at three metaphors now. I’ll quit while I’m ahead.</br>
