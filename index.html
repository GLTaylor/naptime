  <h3> Hello Webiverse </h3>
  <p> I'm learning how to write code. Some thoughts I have now:
    <ul>
      <li> I never thought it was <strong>so much work</strong> </li>
      <li> I hope I can build my own Writer's Portfolio </li>
      <li> Can I do this? Yes. <b style= "color:yellow"> Will I do this? Yes. </b> </li>
      <li> This page is comically ugly but that <em> will change!</em> </li>
  </p>
