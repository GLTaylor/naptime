  <h3> A Three Month Blog Thing </h3>
  <h4> Newly Plopped below: <em> shortened </em> Statement of Purpose </h4>
 

<p class="introduction"> I’m participating in a Spring Language Challenge in which I learn German with a brave group of 24 colleagues over three months, which I shall chronicle in very, very brief episodes here. WHY BRIEF TAYLOR? I’m glad you asked. Because I am also coding this website, and more words is more coding, and I don't want to run out of steam.</p>  

<p class="introduction">  So. </p> 

<p class="introduction"> Check out the Blog page for German Stories, and the Stuff Tab to see what I’m playing with in Coding Land. I’m very new at this so it’s not going to impress anyone, but ENFPs are also known to be open books. Look at that, we’re at three metaphors now. I’ll quit while I’m ahead.</p>
