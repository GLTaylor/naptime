<h2 style=text-align:center> Day 3 </h2> 
<p class=blogthing> As part of my German learning, I sent Valentines </p>
<p class=blogthing> Babbel allows you to send anonymous (or not) cards to people on the (two) days leading up to Valentines Day.</p> 

<p class=blogthing>Do I participate? Yes I do, I love this holiday, pipe down V-day haters</p>

<img src="ohrrn.jpg" alt="All The Things">  

<p class=blogthing>WRITE ALL THE CARDS FOR EVERYONE</p>

<p class=blogthing>But really, that was part of our assignment - send someone else in the group a Valentine “auf Deutsch”</p>

<p class=blogthing>I perused our chatroom for members that seemed to have just a nugget of enthusiasm about this thing and selected three people to send NOT JUST A V CARD, nay, but a POEM, because unfortunately this is where all my Valentine attention is focused this year, folks. I have nowhere to put all this natural affinity for causeless but true affection for celebrating affection itself. In other words, I like this kitschy, stupid holiday if only because it’s an excuse to tell someone else something nice. If it’s a lie well that’s on you bud.</p>
