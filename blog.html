<h2 style=text-align:center> Day 3 </h2> 
<p class="blogthing"> As part of my German learning, I sent Valentines </p>
<p class="blogthing"> Babbel allows you to send anonymous (or not) cards to people on the (two) days leading up to Valentines Day.</p> 

<p class="blogthing">Do I participate? Yes I do, I love this kitschy stupid holiday, pipe down V-day haters</p>

<img style= margin-left:30px src="ohrrn.jpg" alt="All The Things">  

<p style= margin:30px> WRITE ALL THE CARDS FOR EVERYONE</p>

<p class="blogthing">But really, that was part of our assignment - send someone else in the group a Valentine “auf Deutsch”</p>

<p class="blogthing">I perused our chatroom for members that seemed to have a nugget of enthusiasm about this thing and selected three people to send a fully (broken) German poem to. </p>
  
<p class="blogthing"> Small problem, I forgot what I wrote. <strong> So if you're reading this, and you got a card from me, and you wouldn't mind my sharing it as my NEXT post (it belongs to you after all), let me know? </strong> </p>
