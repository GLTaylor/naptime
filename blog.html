<h2 style=text-align:center> Going For a Walk? </h2> 
<p class="blogthing"> I went to Norway last week and stayed in a small house in the middle of Skulsfjord, which is Almost Nowhere. </p>

<p class="blogthing"> The other guest in this house was a French gal. She could speak Spanish, Italian, French of course, and a little English, but only a little </p>
  
<p class="blogthing"> A natural extrovert, I want to continue to chat about our plans for the day. On our second morning, I ask her "Sprechen Sie Deutsch?" She smiled (a little nervously): "Ja, ein bisschen." </p>
  
<p class="blogthing"> Thrilled, I decided we would continue our conversation in German. I lauched into: </p>
  
  <h3 class="blogthing"> "Gehen Sie heute für ein Laufen?" </h3>
  
<p class="blogthing"> Her smile faded (nooooooo!) and she tilted her head. "Perhaps, onward with English still?" </p>
  
  <p class="blogthing"> It was later that I learned the correct way to phrase my question. </p>
  
  <h3 class="blogthing"> "Gehst du spazieren?" </h3>
  
  <p class="blogthing" style= "margin: 0px 50px 30px 50px"> And now I know. Though perhaps next time I'll clarify first that "wir Düzen uns." </p>
  
  
<h2 style=text-align:center> Valentines </h2> 
  
<p class="blogthing"> As part of my German learning, I sent Valentines. </p>
  
<p class="blogthing"> Babbel allows you to send anonymous (or not) cards to people on the (two) days leading up to Valentines Day.</p> 

<p class="blogthing">Do I participate? Yes I do, I love this kitschy stupid holiday, pipe down V-day haters.</p>

<img style= margin-left:30px src="ohrrn.jpg" alt="All The Things">  

<p style= margin:30px> WRITE ALL THE CARDS FOR EVERYONE</p>

<p class="blogthing">But really, that was part of our assignment - send someone else in the group a Valentine “auf Deutsch.”</p>

<p class="blogthing">I perused our chatroom for members that seemed to have a nugget of enthusiasm about this thing and selected three people to send a fully (broken) German poem to. </p>
  
<p class="blogthing"> Small problem, I forgot what I wrote. <strong> So if you're reading this, and you got a card from me, and you wouldn't mind my sharing it as my NEXT post (it belongs to you after all), let me know? </strong> </p>
