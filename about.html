  <p style= "padding: 60px"> Taylor is a person who writes. Her work has appeared (in? at?) ExBerliner, VICE, indieWIRE, Quartz, and Christianity Today. Soon she will have her own website where all of this can be found, but for now if you're at all curious, you can google her and <em> something </em> will turn up. She lives in Berlin and wrote this description by herself. She is learning to code as well which is why this website is currently a mess.</p>
